## Development

To release patch, minor or major version:

    % npm run release:patch
    % npm run release:minor
    % npm run release:major

This will run eslint, compile sources from `src/` to `lib/`, `es/` and `dist/`, bump a
version in `package.json` and then create a new git commit with tag. If tests or
linter fails â€” commit won't be created. If tasks succeed it publishes to npm and pushes a tag to github.
